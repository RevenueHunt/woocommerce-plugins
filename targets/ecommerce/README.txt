Create quizzes with our **AI-powered quiz builder**, gain insights into your customers’ preferences, and sync results with your mailing list or CRM to launch high-ROI marketing campaigns.  
Start creating personalized shopping experiences that boost engagement, conversions, and loyalty.

**WHAT YOU'LL ACHIEVE**

1. **Boost sales** by guiding customers to their perfect products on the first visit.  
2. **Recover abandoned carts** by sending personalized quiz results straight to their inbox.  
3. **Grow your audience** by capturing and syncing leads with your mailing list or CRM.  
4. **Save time on support** by helping shoppers understand your products before they buy.
5. **Reduce returns** by helping customers choose the products that truly fit their needs.  

**HOW IT WORKS**

Think of it as having a **digital personal shopper** in your WooCommerce store. The quiz asks customers a few tailored questions, analyzes their responses, and recommends the best products — complete with personalized explanations that build trust and increase conversions.

Our top-performing merchants use the quiz as the **first step of their automated sales funnel**. It helps them capture leads, segment their audience, and send targeted campaigns that drive repeat purchases. (Highly segmented campaigns can deliver over [3x more revenue per recipient](https://www.klaviyo.com/marketing-resources/segmentation-benchmark-report "Klaviyo Segmentation Benchmark Report") than unsegmented ones!)

== External services ==

This plugin connects to RevenueHunt to build and serve your product recommendation quiz. It relies on these external services:

1. Quiz widget — On your storefront the plugin loads the quiz script from https://admin.revenuehunt.com/embed.js. When a shopper interacts with the quiz, their answers are sent to RevenueHunt to compute and display product recommendations. The script is not loaded on cart or checkout pages.
2. Connection check — From the plugin's admin page only, your store domain is sent to https://api.revenuehunt.com/api/v1/woocommerce/check to verify that your store's REST API is reachable during setup.
3. Account connection — During setup, your store's WooCommerce API credentials and connection identifiers are exchanged with RevenueHunt's servers to link your store to your RevenueHunt account.

Data is sent to RevenueHunt only as needed to provide the quiz. For details, see RevenueHunt's Privacy Policy (https://revenuehunt.com/privacy/), Terms of Service (https://revenuehunt.com/tos/), and Security overview (https://revenuehunt.com/security/).

== Changelog ==

= 2.5.0 =
* New - Capture the connecting store operator (the logged-in WordPress admin) as a contact, in addition to the store email.

= 2.4.0 =
* New - Place the quiz inline anywhere with the [product_recommendation_quiz] shortcode or the new "Product Recommendation Quiz" block in the block editor.
* New - "Full width quiz" option on the inline block/shortcode makes a placed quiz break out of the content column and span the full width of the screen.
* New - WordPress Site Health now reports the plugin's prerequisites (permalink structure, HTTPS, WPML compatibility and REST API reachability), so issues are easy to spot in the standard place.
* Dev - Declared compatibility with the WooCommerce Cart and Checkout Blocks, so the plugin shows as compatible and is not flagged.
* Dev - Placement is built on a delivery-agnostic seam and a pluggable connection layer that future editions reuse.

= 2.3.10 =
* New - The plugin's admin screens, setup flow and error notices are now fully translatable, so they display in your WordPress language wherever a translation exists (community translations via translate.wordpress.org).
* Dev - Internationalization pass: admin sentences are now single, whole translatable strings (no fragments), the translation template regenerates from source in the build, and CI guards translation freshness.

= 2.3.9 =
* Fix - Hardened rate limiting on the connection endpoints (throttle by server-verified IP; ignore the spoofable X-Forwarded-For header unless a proxy is explicitly trusted; no fail-open when the IP is unknown)
* Fix - Deactivating the plugin no longer deletes your connection credentials; only uninstalling does
* Fix - Connection credentials are now format-validated, and the plugin sends a fixed user-agent to its API instead of forwarding the visitor's
* Dev - The WordPress and WooCommerce editions now build from a single shared source; external services are now documented in the readme

= 2.3.7 =
* Dev - Refreshed plugin intro video on the WordPress.org listing

= 2.3.6 =
* Dev - Tested up to WooCommerce 10.7.0

= 2.3.5 =
* Dev - Replace raw cURL with WordPress HTTP API (wp_remote_post) for better hosting compatibility
* Dev - Use wp_parse_url() for cross-PHP-version URL parsing consistency
* Dev - Prefix REST API callback functions to align with WordPress.org naming conventions

= 2.3.4 =
* Dev - tested up to WP 7.0
* Dev - PHP 8.5 compatibility (avoid redundant curl_close on PHP 8.5+)

= 2.3.3 =
* Fix - Skip loading embed.js on WooCommerce checkout and cart pages to prevent connection timeouts from blocking critical shopping pages
* Fix - Load embed.js with async attribute so a slow or failed connection to RevenueHunt servers never blocks page rendering

= 2.3.2 =
* Fix - Exclude .dev TLD from local development detection patterns (.dev is a legitimate production domain owned by Google)

= 2.3.1 =
* Fix - OAuth authorization showing localhost.run URL on production sites when WP_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE is set to 'development' or 'local'

= 2.3.0 =
* Refactor - Code refactoring, security improvements, and enhanced maintainability
